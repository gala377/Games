# Silent Cave

Game written with 2 of my friends in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2017 which topic was "Waves"
A generic endless runner where using your voice allows to alter some actions.
Like shouting while in air makes double jump 

## Controls
You can play on keybord and jostick

Down arrow to duck.
Space (or Up arrow I don't remember) to jump

Modifiers with shout:
  - Shouting while running makes waves that destroy boulders
  - Shouting while midair allows for double jump
  - Shouting while ducking allows for dash which destroys blue crystals

## Technology
Made in C# with Unity

## Where can I play?
It can be downloaded [here](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/silent-cave-0)

## It was a group effort, so what did you do?
It was a group Project so not all of the files where written by me
This is the list of the ones that were:
- EndScreen.cs 
- GameManager.cs (edited by my friend who hardcoded some values :) )
- MenuManager.cs
- Player.cs
- SoundBall.cs
- Sounder.cs 
- SounderTest.cs
- IgorEventSystemS witch is custom Unity Event system I written based on strings (unfortunetly)
			and delegates. It is not one project thing only and I use it for almost
			all of my projects 
	
I also worked on audio side of the game, textures and menu screen background 
I'm a programmer though ;) 

Classes lack documentation however, as I mentioned before it was written from scratch in just about 48
hours with little to no sleep :D
